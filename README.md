# CSI-Microbes Identification

This repository contains the workflows to identify microbial reads from scRNA-seq data.

## Set-up

This workflow is only set-up to be run on the NIH Biowulf cluster. This workflow expects that conda has been installed. For instructions on how to install conda, see [conda install documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/).

Next, the GitHub repository needs to be cloned as below.

```
git clone git@github.com:ruppinlab/CSI-Microbes-identification.git
```

This repository uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), which need to be initialized and fetched.

```
cd CSI-Microbes-identification
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Aulicino2018

There are two key sets of output files generated by this pipeline for Aulicino2018. The first set of files are the read count files resulting from directly mapping the unaligned reads (the reads that do not map to the human genome) against the _Salmonella_ strain genome used for infection (_LT2_ or _D23580_) using SRPRISM.

The second set of files are the read counts files resulting from running PathSeq with a large database of microbial genomes on the unaligned reads (the reads that do not map to the human genome).


## Ben-Moshe2019

There are two key sets of output files generated by this pipeline for Ben-Mosh2019. The first set of files are the read count files resulting from directly mapping the unaligned reads (the reads that do not map to the human genome) against the _Salmonella SL1344_ strain genome used for infection.

The second set of files are the read counts files resulting from running PathSeq with a large database of microbial genomes on the unaligned reads (the reads that do not map to the human genome).

Currently, the pipeline is set-up to generate the second set of files. To generate these files, from the top-level directory (CSI-Microbes-analysis), you should run the below command, which uses snakemake to submit the necessary jobs to the Biowulf cluster

```
./scripts/run-Ben-Moshe2019.sh
```
